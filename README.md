# signature_recognition
Signature recognition is a behavioural biometric. It can be operated in two ways: Static: In this mode, users write their signature on paper, and digitize it through an optical scanner or a camera, and the biometric system recognizes the signature by analyzing its shape. This group is also known as “off-line”. Dynamic: In this mode, users write their signature on a digitised tablet, which acquires the signature in real-time. Another possibility is the acquisition by means of stylus-operated PDAs. Some systems also operate on smart-phones or tablets with a capacitive screen, where users can sign using a finger or an appropriate pen. Dynamic recognition is also known as “on-line”. Dynamic information usually consists of the following information:
